# mnist -classfication
Logistic Regression Classification!

In this project, I will be creating a machine learning algorithm using only numpy techniques to classify an MNIST database of 60,000 images of handwritten digits.

All the code will be derived from first principles using my knowledge of statistics, optimisation and linear algebra, as such,  no external machine learning libraries will be used. 

The project will focus on hyper parameter tuning strategies, as well as regularisation, to create the most optimal learning algorithms. 

A full extensive report has been written documenting my findings too!
